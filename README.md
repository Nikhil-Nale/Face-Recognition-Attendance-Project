# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Project
Create an Attendance project that will use webcam to detect faces and record the attendance live in an excel sheet. 


The system is developed for deploying an easy and a secure way of taking down attendance. The software first captures an image of all the authorized persons and stores the information into database. The system then stores the image by mapping it into a face coordinate structure. Next time whenever the registered person enters the premises the system recognizes the person and marks his attendance along with the time.

It saves their time and efforts.


Disadvantages:
The system donâ€™t recognize properly in poor light so may give false results.
